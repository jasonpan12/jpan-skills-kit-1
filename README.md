# Introduction
This is a function that runs on the [Serverless](https://serverless.com/) framework with [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). The function is invoked by an event generated by [Box Skills](https://developer.box.com/page/box-skills-kit), and uses [Clarifai](https://clarifai.com) to generate potential image categories.
